## Out of the box support:
* Out of the box the theme supports:
* Pages, posts
* One main menu
* One social links menu
* Comments
* Dynamic sidebar with custom widgets
* Editable main hero section

## Requirements:
The only requirement of the theme is [Timber plugin](https://es.wordpress.org/plugins/timber-library/) installed on your WordPress.

## Customizing:
I implemented Gulp for compiling and minimizing the sass styles and javascript code. So if you want to customize the code you need NodeJS installed and after run gulp for watch your changes. On the theme folder you should do:
```
cd /static/assets
npm install
gulp
```

## Why use Twig, Timber and Wordpress?
You know that the WordPress themes are not so lyrically written in contradiction with their good slogan *"code is poetry"*. But thinking it better they could be an ode to the Spaghetti. So, away from jokes now, the code of the themes are very messy, mixing up html, php, css, and js sometimes. But the good news is that there is a solution for this headache and his name is **Timber**. This plugin makes the life  of the Wordpress developers easier implementing the **Twig template system** making that you can avoid the Spaghetti code.
